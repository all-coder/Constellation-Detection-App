# Project-2---Star-Recognition-App

I developed this app for Gagan Vedhi at IIT Tirupati. I am part of a ongoing project, where the primary goal is to detect the constellation from images of night skies. I developed the app primarily using flutter. 
The backend was constructed using Flask to establish a connection between the app and the python scripts necessary for the processing of images. Firebase was also used in this project, to store the unprocessed and as well the processed images and were retrieved and uploaded as URLs.
The openweather map api was also used to display the weather based on the user's location.
